# BioNetworksTutorial_ICSB2016
15 September, Barcelona
Venue: TBA
Time: 9.00-19.00

Biological network maps: from construction to data analysis and applications in research and clinics

Motivation 
Today's biology is largely data-driven, thanks to high-throughput technologies that allow investigating molecular and cellular aspects of life on large scales. Making biological sense out of the amount of produced data requires their interpretation in the context cellular and physiological processes. However the knowledge about molecular signalling mechanisms is dispersed in thousands of publications, precluding application of methods and algorithms developed in the field of bioinformatics and systems biology. There is a need in formalized compilation of biological knowledge in a computer-readable form, as bio-molecular networks.
To overcome the robustness of cell signalling network, disease treatment should be extended to a combination therapy approach. Integrating and analysing patient high-throughput data together with the information about biological signalling machinery may help deciphering molecular patterns specific to each patient and finding the best combinations of candidates for therapeutic targeting. Approaches in the field of systems medicine from the network biology perspective will be discussed.

Learning objective
1.	Expose the participants to several methodologies of network construction and data analysis in the context of networks.
2.	Provide the participants with number of optimized working scenarios that can be directly applied in their own research.

Intended audience 
The tutorial targets a wide audience as computational systems biologists, molecular and cell biologists, clinicians, who are interested in update and learning of approaches in network biology and related analysis tools, including visualization and analysis of multi-level omics data in the context of biological networks. The presenters are computational systems biologists that will share their experience and suggest simple and proven scenarios on integration of the tools into basic and clinical research. 

No previous experience or computational background is required to attend the workshop. 
The tutorial will include hands-on sessions; the audients are advised to bring their laptop computers.
